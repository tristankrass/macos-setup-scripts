# Readme

Heavily inspired by [this repo](https://github.com/JJGO/macOS-setup)

The repository contains the files I use to configure a new installation of OS X/macOS to my liking.

I will try to keep it up to date as much as possible, but I can't guarantee that it will always be the case, as I don't change laptops that often.

## Usage

On first run you need to do `make init`

On subsequent runs just `make main`
